Operating on a "cap-and-trade" model, ETS sets a limit on carbon emissions for industries and allocates allowances to companies. Those that emit below their allocated limits can sell excess allowances to others, fostering a financial incentive for reducing emissions. This system encourages industries to adopt greener technologies, reduce their carbon footprints, and invest in energy-efficient practices.',
